**Authenticate and subscribe to the API Service (LTA Data Mall) using the userâ€™s API key.**
> Format : `auth API_KEY`

- LTA Data Mall API information (click [here](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html)).
- API Registration (click [here](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/request-for-api.html)).
API key will be emailed to you.
- `API_KEY` is case sensitive and unique.
- Upon successful authentication, the key will be stored locally and future authentication is not required.
- User can use `auth` to change the current key. Only one and the most recent key will be stored.
- If API key is invalid, the new key will not be stored and the previous key will be retained. 
If there are no API key beforehand, it will stay empty.
