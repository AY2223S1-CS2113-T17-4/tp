# User Guide

## Introduction

parKING is a desktop app that helps drivers choose the best place to park via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
parKING allows users to search, save and look at carpark availability information at a glance,
while interfacing with LTA's real-time API that updates every minute. You can use parKING to plan trips in advance or 
simply check lot availability before you leave the house.



## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of parKING from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2113-T17-4/tp/releases/download/v2.0/parKING.jar).
3. Use the command `java -jar parKING.jar` to start the program!

## Disclaimer regarding use of API key for the purposes of NUS CS2113
We understand that an api key is something personal and should not be shared with everyone. However, for the purpose of
NUS CS2113, we have provided a default api key for testing purposes.

### Authenticate user API

**Authenticate and subscribe to the API Service (LTA Data Mall) using the userâ€™s API key.**
> Format : `auth API_KEY`

- LTA Data Mall API information (click [here](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/dynamic-data.html)).
- API Registration (click [here](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/request-for-api.html)).
  API key will be emailed to you.
- `API_KEY` is case sensitive and unique.
- Upon successful authentication, the key will be stored locally and future authentication is not required.
- User can use `auth` to change the current key. Only one and the most recent key will be stored.
- If API key is invalid, the new key will not be stored and the previous key will be retained.
  If there are no API key beforehand, it will stay empty.
- Upon successful authentication, a fetching sequence will be initiated from the LTA API.

Example of usage:

**Input (assuming 12345678 is a valid API key)**

```auth 12345678```

**Output**
```
2312 Parking Lot data received from LTA!
Authenticated successfully.
```

### Authenticate default

**Authenticate using the default API key.**
> Format: `auth default`

- For user with no API key, they can use the provided api key to access the services.
- User will not be able to see the api key.
- A fetching sequence will be initiated also from LTA API.

Example of usage:

**Input**

```auth default```

**Output**

```
2312 Parking Lot data received from LTA!
Authenticated successfully using default API Key.
```

### Authentication status

**Get the status of the api key authentication status.**
> Format: `auth status`

- It will inform the user whether the user api key is entered and valid or whether the default API key is used.
- If user has entered and validated their personal key before, they will be able to view their own API key.
  Otherwise, the default API key will not be revealed to the user.

Example of usage:

**Input**

```auth status```

**Output**
1. If user has inputted his personal API key and is authenticated

```
You have authenticated your API key successfully. API key stored in the local file is ********
```

2. If user has not inputted his personal API key and/or not authenticated

```
You have not authenticated your personal API key. Currently you have access to the API but you are using our default key!
```

### Find number of lots available by carpark ID

**Returns the number of lots available in the carpark that the user has chosen to find.**
> Format: `find CARPARK_ID`

- Using data from the API, after the user has inputted the ID of a certain carpark,
  the function will return the number of lots available in aforementioned carpark.
- If the user inputs a non-existing carpark ID or inputs the wrong format,
  the program will prompt the user to re-enter the correct and existing carpark ID.
- `find` is case-insensitive and will find the correct carpark code even if lowercase is used.

Example of usage:

**Input:**

```find a9```

**Output:**
```
===========================================
BLK 202/203 ANG MO KIO STREET 22
===========================================
Carpark code: A9
Favourited: Yes
Number of available lots (total): 132
  Cars: 66 lots
  Motorcycles: 0 lots
  Heavy Vehicles: 0 lots
===========================================
```

### Filter carparks based on address

**Shows a list of carparks that match a given query.**
> Format: `filter QUERY`

- The filter command allows the user to search a carpark based on the name of the carpark. For example,
  a carpark may have the name of `BLK 208 CLEMENTI AVE 6` - a query of `clementi` or `208` will return this
  carpark as one of its results.
- Multiple words can be input to narrow the filtered results further. Given the previous example, `clementi ave` will
  also give the above carpark as one of its results.
- For convenience, the `filter` command also matches substrings at the _beginning_ of a word. Following the previous
  example, `clem` will also match the above carpark.
- In carpark names, matched words will be wrapped with ` to easily see at a glance what was matched.

Example of usage

**Input:**

```filter clem ave 2```

**Output:**
```    
CarparkID C5 at BLK 358-360,36`2`-363,366-367 `CLEMENTI` `AVE` `2`
    806 available lots total
CarparkID C8 at BLK 335/338 `CLEMENTI` `AVE` `2`
    356 available lots total
CarparkID C28M at BLK `208` `CLEMENTI` `AVE` 6
    370 available lots total
CarparkID C6 at BLK 3`2`8-334 `CLEMENTI` `AVE` `2`
    226 available lots total
CarparkID C7 at BLK 349-355 `CLEMENTI` `AVE` `2`
    304 available lots total
```

### Get a list of available carparks on the app

**Returns a list of the available carparks from the JSON file.**
> Format: `list`

- Using data from the API, after the user has inputted the command, the function will return a list of carparks from the API.

Example of usage:

**Input:**

 `list`

**Output:**

```
CarparkID T0129 at TANJONG KATONG COMPLEX
   182 available lots total
CarparkID KU1 at BLK 301/305-306/311-318 UBI AVENUE 1

CarparkID HG80 at BLK 941A HOUGANG STREET 92
   730 available lots total
```

### Update data from API

**Fetches the most updated availability data and stores it locally.**
> Format: `update`

- The command requires a valid API access token to function.
- This overwrites any previous availability data for any carparks fetched by the API.

Example of usage:

**Input**

 `update`

**Output**

```
2312 Parking Lot data received from LTA!

```

### Favourite carparks by carpark ID

**Saves the carpark to a list of favourited carparks for easy subsequent access.**
> Format: `favourite CARPARK_ID`

- The command requires user to input a valid and existing carpark ID that is not already favourited.

Example of usage:

**Input (assuming carpark ID 1 is not favourited):**

```favourite 1```

**Output:**

```
Added Carpark 1 to favourites!
```

**Input (assuming carpark ID J8 is already favourited):**

```favourite J8```

**Output:**

```

```

**Input:**

```favourite not_a_carpark_ID```

## FAQ

**Q**: How is the data for the carparks stored? Can I change or edit this data?

**A**: The carpark data is first fetched in a `.json` format, under
`.\resources\api\ltaResponse.json`. Then, this carpark data is written
to a `.txt` file at `.\resources\carparkList.txt`. If you wish to manually edit any
carpark data, you can do so as long as the format is maintained. These changes will be reflected
when you restart the program.
