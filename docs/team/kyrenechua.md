## Project: parKING
parKING is a desktop app that helps drivers choose the best place to park via the Command Line Interface (CLI).
parKING allows users to search, save and look at car park availability information at a glance, while interfacing with
LTA's real-time API. 

Given below are my contributions to the project:
* New feature: Added the `auth` command to authenticate the user's secret api key.
* New feature: Added the `update` command to update the data from the api.
* New feature: Added the `Command`, `CommandResult`, `Parser` classes to parse the user input and return the command and
command result.
* Enhancement to code:
  * Refactored the code to improve readability, and meet OOP standards.
